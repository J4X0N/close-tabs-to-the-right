# Close Tabs to the Right
This WebExtension (re)adds a context menu option to browser tabs to close tabs to the right of the selected one.
Tested with Firefox 78.

# Localisation
For a full localisation, three strings are needed:
- extensionName: the name of the extension that will appear in the addon menu.
- extensionDescription: the description for the addon
- contextItemTitle: the text that appears in the actual context menu. To define an access key (the keyboard shortcut to quickly activate the menu item), prepend the letter that corresponds to the access key in the string with &. This letter will appear underlined in the context menu.
Please see the english locale for reference.
